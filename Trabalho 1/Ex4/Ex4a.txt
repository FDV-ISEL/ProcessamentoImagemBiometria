a) Identify the types of noise/distortion; propose a technique to restore it to its
original contents. Explain the proposed technique

Image: type of noise

face: Gaussian
face_thermogram: Salt and pepper
finger: Periodic
iris: Film grain
squares: Salt and pepper
XRay: Quantization

Techniques:

Gaussian: Unsharp masking
Salt and pepper: Non-linear spatial filtering / median filter
Periodic: Frequency domain notch filters
